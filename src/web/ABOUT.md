#About Websocket Transmission

**Websocket Server âžœ Client Communication**

The navigation program also contains support for displaying dynamic a webpage, which will update with critical data pertaining to the state of the sail boat. It includes a map, a panel of variables, and a console of output.

The socket is defined in `websocket-client.js`:

    socket = new WebSocket('ws://127.0.0.1:80/ws');

When the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) setup is connected to a network, simply navigating to the IP of the device in a browser will render the page.

This side of the program is written entirely in native Javascript and CSS. No extra dependencies are required.

**Transmission Specifications**

All data sent to the client must contain the `category` tag. This is done so the client can sort the three types of messages it expects from the server:

 1. routine data messages: `category='data'`
 2. marker additions: `category='marker'`
 3. console logging messages: `category='log'`
